The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued guidelines to determine equivalent posts, but these guidelines have not been universally accepted.\n\nThe guidelines state that the following are considered equivalent to the post of Joint Secretary to the Government of India:\n• Additional Secretary to the Government of India\n• Secretary to a Ministry or Department of the Government of India\n• Chief Secretary of a State Government\n• Vice-Chancellor of a Central University\n• Director of a National Institute\n\n However, there are some who argue that those suggestions are not complete enough and that there are different posts that must be considered equal to Joint Secretaries to the Government of India. They argue that the recommendations must be amended to encompass the subsequent posts:\n• Director of a Central Government Organization\n• Head of a Central Government Agency\n• Director of a National Research Institute\n• Vice-Chairman of a Central Government Commission\n\n The debate over the criteria for determining equivalent posts to Joint Secretaries to the Government of India is likely to continue. The Ministry of Home Affairs may issue revised guidelines in the future, but until then, the existing guidelines will continue to be used.\n\n It is important to note that the determination of equivalent posts is not limited to the purpose of Article 26. Equivalent posts are also used for other purposes, such as determining precedence and determining eligibility for certain benefits.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.
