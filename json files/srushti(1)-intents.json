The draft bill is prepared by the Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Department and forwarded to the originating department for additional documents like Statements of Objects and Reasons and Financial Memorandum.\n(3) Approvals and Processes: The draft bill goes through several stages of approval by relevant authorities, ensuring compliance with constitutional provisions. Administrative approvals and necessary sanctions or recommendations are obtained promptly.\n(4) Legislative Processing: Bills are introduced in the state legislature, forwarded to the Governor and Central Government for information, and may involve multiple departments for examination and circulation.\n(5) Governance and Final Steps: Bills passed by the legislature are examined and forwarded to the Governor for assent. In cases where the Governor directs for reservation or return to the legislature, necessary actions are taken.\n(6) Ordinances and Other Actions: Procedures for ordinances, amendments, and consultations with the Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Department for legal opinions or revisions are outlined.\n(7) Consultations and Legal Matters: All administrative departments are required to consult the Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Department/Legal Department for various legal matters, such as interpretation of statutes, legal principles from cases, and decisions on prosecutions.\n In essence, this passage details how the Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Department contributes to the legislative process by ensuring legal compliance, drafting bills, facilitating approvals, and providing necessary consultations on legal matters to other government departments."
