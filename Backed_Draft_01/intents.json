The GFC outlines the procedures and requirements for obtaining financial approval from the Finance Department for various government activities.<br><br>Here are some of the key rules regarding consultation with the Finance Department in Gujarat:<br><br>1. Prior Approval for Financial Commitments: Before making any financial commitments, such as entering into contracts, sanctioning grants, or incurring expenditure, government departments must obtain prior approval from the Finance Department. This ensures that financial resources are allocated judiciously and in accordance with the government's overall fiscal priorities.<br>2. Preparation of Budget Proposals: All government departments are required to prepare detailed budget proposals for their planned expenditures. These proposals must be submitted to the Finance Department for review and approval. The Finance Department evaluates the proposals based on their financial implications, alignment with government objectives, and adherence to budgetary guidelines.<br>3. Consultation for Policy Changes: Any proposed changes to existing policies or the introduction of new policies that have financial implications must be discussed with the Finance Department. This ensures that financial considerations are factored into policy decisions and that the government's financial commitments are not jeopardized.<br>4. Submission of Financial Statements: Government departments are required to submit periodic financial statements, such as quarterly and annual accounts, to the Finance Department. These statements provide a transparent view of the department's financial performance and enable the Finance Department to monitor the utilization of funds.<br>5. Compliance with Financial Regulations: All government departments must adhere to the financial regulations and guidelines set by the Finance Department. These regulations cover aspects such as budgeting, expenditure control, revenue management, and accounting procedures.<br>6. Seek Clarification and Guidance: Government departments are encouraged to seek clarification and guidance from the Finance Department whenever they encounter ambiguity or uncertainties related to financial matters. This proactive approach helps to avoid delays, discrepancies, and potential irregularities.<br><br> In addition to these specific rules, the GFC also emphasizes the importance of maintaining open communication and collaboration between government departments and the Finance Department. This fosters a culture of financial discipline, transparency, and accountability within the government system.<br><br>By following these rules and promoting a collaborative approach to budgeting, the Government of Gujarat strives to ensure efficient use of public funds, sound budgeting and overall economic stability.<br><br>I hope this helps.
